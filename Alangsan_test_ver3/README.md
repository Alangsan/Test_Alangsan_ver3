###Folder design

I've designed a folder structure as the following below 

Alangsan_test 
│
├── handler # Contain the API handlers 
│	└── wrapper.py # wrapper function to call all API handlers
│ 
│
├── calculator # Contains any modules that requires calculation 
│	└── calculator.py # wrapper function to call all API handlers
│ 
│
├── test # Contains test scripts 
│   	└── example.py # Example script for using the package 
│ 
│
└── README.md

###Informations

I've wrote 5 functions to call API links from Binance, CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, Kraken, 
and Okex in the file name 'wrapper.py'


In the 'example.py' file, it has variable name 'input_' which you can insert a list of 
the cryptocurrency symbol "in one straight line". And when you run the program, it will 
print out the median of the corresponding price in USD or an error.


For the filtering data method, I compare all the 5 values and find percentage of the difference.
If the percentage of the difference is more than 5%, that number must be rejected. 
Example [1001, 1005, 560, 989, 1020] 
	compare 1001 to 1005 the difference is 0.39% 
	compare 1001 to 560 the difference is 44.05% 
	compare 1001 to 989 the difference is 1.19% 
	compare 1001 to 1020 the difference is 1.89% 
So that's mean 560 must be rejected. But if base number(For this case is 1001) makes all percentage 
different more than 5%, the base number must be rejected instead.


If I have more time, I will do the following below.
	1. Set variable more comfortable.
	2. Write functions more efficiently.
	3. Make coding more organized
	4. Study about "structs" :)
